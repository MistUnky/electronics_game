 This tool can be used @1 times before breaking.=
A triggering device that allows teleportation via warpfield.=
Cooldown: @1s=

Find all warp maxima accessible from within the given volume, starting from test points separated by step_size. These are places that are difficult or impossible to reach by warpfield teleport.=

Find all warp minima accessible from within the given volume, starting from test points separated by step_size. These are locations that players who repeatedly teleport will eventually wind up.=

Incorrect argument format. Expected: "(x1,y1,z1) (x2,y2,z2) number [number]"=

Warpfield Trigger=

When triggered, this tool and its user will be displaced in accordance with the local warp field's displacement. Simply holding it makes it act as a compass of sorts, showing the current strength of the warp field.=

With @1 successful and @2 failed runs found the following maxima (rounded to @3m):=

With @1 successful and @2 failed runs found the following minima (rounded to @3m):=

locate the nearest warpfield minimum by following the field downhill from the provided location, or from the player's location if not provided. This is where a player starting at that position will eventually wind up if they repeatedly travel by warp, not counting any falls along the way.=
